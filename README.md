# calosjs
The aim of this library is to simplify the usage of that jQuery $ object, and add all function to current scope.
Anyone who has interest can join this project, I have implemented some features and some common functions like queue, animation,
dom css manipulation. We can cooperate together to make this come into real!

Expecting your code!
Let's make it easier and faster!
a raw javascript library for manipulation of DOM, like jquery, but extends some new features and is not so big like those libraries and can be used by functions like PHP.
