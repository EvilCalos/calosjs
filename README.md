# calosjs
The aim of this library is to simplify the usage of that jQuery $ object, and add all function to current scope.
Anyone who has interest can join this project, I have implemented some features and some common functions like queue, animation, events capture, events propagation, dom css manipulation etc. We can cooperate together to make this come into real.
The cool part of this library is the usage which always comes with the object id or element itself, and the optionals are always on the right but the function declarations are always on the left, and support element chain call.
When it is written, the style is like below:

width(height(css('e1','color','red'),'200px'),300)
so, it is a very pretty style, at least in my opinion, how do you feel?

If you are interested, you can also contribute to this project.
I'm expecting any kind guy who can give aid on this style.

#introduction
a raw javascript library for manipulation of DOM, like jquery, but extends some new features and is not so big like those libraries and can be used by functions like PHP.
