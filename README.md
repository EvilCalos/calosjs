The aim of this library is to simplify the usage of that jQuery $ object, and add all function to current scope.
Any one who has interest can join in this project, I have implemented some features and some common functions like queue, animation,
dom css manipulation. We can cooperate together to make this come into real!

Expecting your code!
Let's make it easier and faster!
my own raw javascript library for manipulation of DOM, like jquery, but extend some new features and is not so big like those libraries and can be used by functions
